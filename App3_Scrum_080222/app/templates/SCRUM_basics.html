<h3>Introduction of scrum.</h3>
<p>Scrum is a framework within which people
     can address complex adaptive problems,
      while productively and creatively delivering products
       of the highest possible value. The framework is designed to be
        lightweight and simple to understand, while still remaining robust
         enough to support complex product development in the face of rapidly
          changing business environments. </p>
