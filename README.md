# Flask-Assessment
Please commit code to your branches so there isn't any issues trying to commit at the same time. Chnages will be merged to the main branch when they have been tested.

Note: Do not use the venv in the folder but your own venv (I have tried my best to get it to work and I cannot turn the venv off once activated)

Please let me know if anything goes wrong ASAP
