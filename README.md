# Flask-Assessment
Please do not directly commit your working code to the main branch. Create new branches and create pull requests to merge onto the main branch (if you don't know how to do either, let me know)

Note: Do not use the venv in the folder but your own venv (I have tried my best to get it to work and I cannot turn the venv off once activated)

Please let me know if anything goes wrong ASAP
